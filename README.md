### My Work Life:
I'm currently Manager of Community at [OpenSSF](openssf.org), and I'm passionate about building and growing open source communities. I'm a co-chair of [Platform Engineering Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/co-located-events/platform-engineering-day/#about) with [Paula Kennedy](https://github.com/paulakennedy), and help out with [OpenGitOps](https://github.com/open-gitops) and [GitOpsCon](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-virtual-project-events-hosted-by-cncf-presents-gitopscon-europe-2025-virtual/) when I can. 

Previously I was a Community Manager at [Stacklok](stacklok.com), working on our [minder](https://github.com/stacklok/minder) project and focusing on building community within the [OpenSSF](openssf.org). Prior to that I was at [Weaveworks](https://github.com/weaveworks) working on various open source projects, including [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) & [Flagger](https://github.com/fluxcd/flagger). During my stint at Weaveowrks, I helped organize and produce [GitOps Days](www.gitopsdays.com) events as well as [Weave Online User Group](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9lTuCFNLaD0wEsbqf6IrGCWvZIAIo9cW) sessions.
